## <**Mars Scraper Project**>

**Overview**
The Mars Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of data related to Mars, focusing on two main deliverables.

**Deliverable 1**: Mars News Articles Scraping
In the first deliverable, the project involves scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Leveraging web scraping techniques, the aim is to gather insightful and up-to-date information about various events, discoveries, and developments related to Mars.

**Deliverable 2**: Mars Weather Data Analysis
The second deliverable extends the analysis to include the scraping and detailed analysis of Mars weather data. This information is extracted from a structured table, and the project aims to provide valuable insights into the atmospheric conditions on Mars. The analysis covers key weather parameters such as temperature and pressure, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the Martian climate.

**Dependencies**
The project relies on popular Python libraries for web scraping (BeautifulSoup) and data analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib).
